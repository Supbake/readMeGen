# ReadMe Generator 
  ## Description

  I created a js file that will allow the user to locally create a readme.md file with a layout and options that any user would need. I was able to use the Inquirer libaray to generate questions for the user to help walk them through the template, when finished the user will see either an Err or an Success for the completion or not. Please use the following link to see video on how to use. https://youtu.be/RiVYyeZrQjQ

  ## Installation

  You need to copy over these files and then in your terminal you need to insure you are on your index.js file and in the terminal you need to use "node index.js" (or your propper file path for the .js file) and then follow the prompts.  

  ## Usage

  You would use this whenever you are creating a(n) new repository for use as this will allow yourself and others to understand the project you have created. 

  ## Credits

  I used .js, node.js, as well as the Inquirer library.
